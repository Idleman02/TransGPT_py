# TransGPT-Plus

## Introduction
TransGPT-Plus is an interactive chatbot application that utilizes the GPT (Generative Pretrained Transformer) model to converse with users. The application is designed to simulate conversations with a machine learning model through a graphical user interface (GUI), providing a user-friendly platform for users to interact with AI technology.

## Features
- **Graphical Chat Interface**: A GUI that facilitates real-time communication with the GPT-based chatbot.
- **Custom Configuration**: Configuration settings that allow for customization of the chatbot's behavior and API integrations.
- **Session Logging**: Chat sessions are logged for record-keeping and analysis.

## Components
The application is composed of several Python scripts, each serving a unique purpose in the project's architecture:

### `main.py`
This is the entry point of the application. It initializes the GUI application, loads the configuration, and launches the main chat window.

### `config.py`
This script defines the `Configuration` class responsible for handling the application's settings. It reads from `config.ini` to obtain necessary configurations like API keys and manages updates to the configuration as needed.

### `chat_window.py`
Defines the `ChatWindow` class, which is the primary window of the application. This script sets up the GUI layout, including tabs for multiple chat sessions and the overall appearance of the chat interface.

### `utils.py`
Contains utility functions, such as validation of the API key, which is essential for interacting with any external services or APIs the chatbot might use.

### `chat_tab.py`
Responsible for individual chat tabs within the main chat window. It manages the conversation within each tab, processing user input, and displaying responses from the chatbot.

## Installation
Before installing TransGPT-Plus, ensure you have Python 3 and pip installed on your system. Follow these steps to set up the application:

```bash
# Clone the repository
git clone [repository-link]
cd TransGPT-Plus

# Install dependencies
pip install -r requirements.txt
```

## Usage
To start the application, run the following command:

```bash
python main.py
```

Once the application is running, use the chat window to communicate with the chatbot. Enter your queries, and the bot will respond accordingly.

## Configuration
You must set your API key and other relevant configurations in the `config.ini` file. This file is essential for the chatbot to function correctly as it may rely on external services for processing conversations.
